I majored in Computer Science at the during my Univeristy Degree studies and so I want to share some things that were covered during my course of study.

## 1. Programming Languages
Recently, Python has been the famous programming language for Data Science and Machine Learning. It is considered the easiest programming language to learn with it's simple syntax and readability. Therefore, my university course thought us Python as the first programming language. It is true that Python might be the easiest to  learn, but Data Science is hard. 

## 2. Using Python for projects
We also had projects to complete both in group and individually. The projects were based on Python and we had to use Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, etc. 
As for group projects, it basically is technical writing and presentation. We had to write a report and present it to the class.
Then, for individual projects, we had to develop a data-analytics application using Python. The application is supposed to detect number of Tweets and comments, likes from Twitter and form a graph. It is kind of like Google Analytics Web Application. I developed the application using Flask. So it involves using other programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.
It is not easy at all as we had to do in a limited time. But it was a good experience.

## 3. Other useful subjects in Computer Science
Other than programming languages, we also had to learn about other subjects such as:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Object Oriented Programming
- Computer Architecture
- Operating Systems
- Database Management Systems
- Computer Networks
- Network Security
- Business Analysis 
- Data Programming

and the list goes on...

So if you really want to get a degree in Computer Science, be ready for a lot of hard work and sleepless nights. But it is worth it.

## 4. My advice
If you are just in high school and wanting to aim for computer science course in University, there's no issue to follow that dream and get into the computer science course. 

However if you are a working adult and had a degree in another field but you want to change your career to computer science, I would suggest you to take a short course in computer science first. This is because, the computer science course in University is very intense and you might not be able to cope with it. So it is better to take a short course first to see if you can handle it. If you can, then you can go for the degree course. If you can't, then you can still use the knowledge you gained from the short course to apply for a job in the computer science field.

These days there are a lot of online computer science courses that you can take. So it is not a problem to take a short course. Some companies even accept people with certificates from online courses, as long as you meet the skills and requirements.
