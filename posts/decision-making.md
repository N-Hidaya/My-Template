After 1 year of learning and working on the Flutter framework, I realized how simple and manageable it is as compared to ReactJS/React Native. I code faster, and complete my projects faster using Flutter. Until now, I've only deployed Flutter applications to mobile platforms. This time, I will try to develop web applications using Flutter and deploy it for the world to see.
