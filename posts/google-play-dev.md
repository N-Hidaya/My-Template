title: 'Google Play Console Account Termination: A Frustrating Journey'

After successfully developing my first Android mobile application, I eagerly set my sights on publishing it on Google Playstore. However, it had been several years since I last accessed my Google Play Console account.

Upon finally regaining access, I was met with a disheartening discovery - my account had been terminated. Desperate for a resolution, I reached out to Google's Help Center and received an email response.

## Seeking Help from Google's Support Center

The Google Help Center's explanation was simple yet distressing. They had deactivated my account due to inactivity over a two-year period. To make matters worse, they conveyed that my account could not be reactivated due to the way the system functionality was designed.

Recollections of my initial foray into the Google Play Console resurfaced. I had initially created my account when I purchased some applications on Flippa and published them on Google Playstore. Regrettably, at that time, I was unable to actively manage those applications and left them dormant. The remorse was palpable.

Now, with my own applications ready for launch, I was confronted with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. The help center suggested creating a new account with a different email address, but it wasn't that simple.

## The Overwhelming Requirements for a New Account

Multiple attempts to create a new account with a different email and name proved futile. The Google Play Console system consistently responded with the discouraging message, 'This account is connected to an existing account.'

Desperate for a solution, I scoured the internet for guidance on creating a fresh account. Unfortunately, the advice I found was overwhelming. Some sources recommended using a different device, IP address, mobile number, location address, bank account number, and email, among other things. It felt like an exorbitant amount of effort.

Additionally, I had switched to a new laptop, which was different from the one I initially used to register for Google Play Console. It appeared that, in order to create a new Google Play Console account, I would need to change my location, open a new bank account, and obtain a new phone contract number. The magnitude of the task ahead was daunting.

## A Plea for a More Streamlined Process

In conclusion, this ordeal highlights the frustrations faced by individuals in my situation. The system in place for Google Play Console account management poses a significant barrier to those attempting to regain access after inactivity. It is my hope that Google Play can streamline this process to better accommodate users who, like me, find themselves in a bind.
