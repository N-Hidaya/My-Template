I pursued a major in Computer Science during my University Degree studies, and I'm excited to share some insights into what was covered throughout my academic journey.

## 1. Programming Languages
In recent years, Python has emerged as the dominant programming language in the realms of Data Science and Machine Learning. Renowned for its simplicity and readability due to its straightforward syntax, Python was the first programming language introduced in my university course. While Python may be regarded as one of the easiest languages to learn, it's essential to acknowledge that mastering Data Science remains a challenging endeavor.

## 2. Leveraging Python for Projects
Our coursework included a variety of projects, both collaborative and individual. These projects were centered around Python and required the utilization of Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, and more. Collaborative projects primarily focused on technical documentation and presentation, necessitating the creation of detailed reports and class presentations.

Individual projects involved the development of data analytics applications using Python. One notable project involved building an application to track the number of Tweets and comments, as well as likes on Twitter, and visualizing the data in the form of graphsâ€”a concept reminiscent of Google Analytics for web applications. I personally developed this application using Flask, which involved incorporating other programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects were both challenging and rewarding, demanding efficient time management.

## 3. Diverse Topics in Computer Science
Beyond programming languages, our curriculum encompassed a wide array of subjects within the field of Computer Science, including:

- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Computer Architecture
- Operating Systems
- Database Management Systems
- Computer Networks
- Network Security
- Business Analysis
- Data Programming

This list is by no means exhaustive, underscoring the comprehensive nature of a Computer Science degree. The pursuit of this degree entails substantial dedication, hard work, and occasional sleepless nights, but the knowledge gained is undoubtedly invaluable.

## 4. Advice for Aspiring Computer Scientists
For those currently in high school with aspirations of pursuing Computer Science at the university level, I encourage you to wholeheartedly pursue your dream and enroll in a Computer Science program.

However, if you're a working adult with a degree in another field but are contemplating a career change to Computer Science, I recommend considering a short introductory course in Computer Science. The rigor of a university-level Computer Science program can be quite demanding, and it's prudent to test the waters before committing fully. Starting with a short course allows you to gauge your aptitude and interest. If you find that you can manage the coursework and thrive, you can then confidently embark on the journey towards a degree in Computer Science. Alternatively, even if you decide against pursuing a degree, the knowledge and skills acquired from the short course can still open doors to career opportunities in the field.

Today, numerous online Computer Science courses are available, offering flexibility and accessibility. Many companies even recognize certificates from online courses, provided you meet the necessary skill and qualification criteria.

So, whether you're a high school student or a working professional, the path to Computer Science is within reach, and your commitment to learning will undoubtedly pay off.
