## Introduction
Are you eager to uncover the secrets behind the creation of this website from scratch? 
In this post, we'll explore the steps I took to build a cost-effective website without
 relying on third-party CMS platforms like WordPress or Wix. By doing so, I avoided the burden of 
 monthly subscription fees, with my only expense being the domain address.

## Dedicating Time Over Money
Rather than investing in expensive tools, I chose to invest my time in mastering web application 
development and expanding my programming skills. Throughout this journey, I acquired valuable knowledge 
in ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript, and JavaScript. The web is a treasure trove of free tutorials, 
available on platforms like YouTube, the official ReactJS Discord server, various programming communities, 
Stack Overflow, and, of course, the ever-reliable Google.

## Website Overview
The website I've meticulously crafted consists of two main components: a homepage and a dedicated 
blog page. On the homepage, you'll discover:

- An "About" section that offers insights into my background and story.
- A "Services" section proudly showcasing my latest custom app creations and the comprehensive range of services I offer.
- A "Skills" section that highlights the skills I've acquired and continue to refine.
- A "Projects" section, providing glimpses of the various websites and applications I've had the privilege to work on.
- A "Contact" section, designed to facilitate easy communication, allowing anyone to reach out and inquire about anything.

## The Blogging Experience
For the Blog page, I've harnessed the power of the MDX markdown formatter to create articles, 
continually refining my skills in this domain. Excitingly, I have plans to revamp these articles 
and implement a blog topic filter for enhanced navigation in the near future.

## Technical Insights
On the technical front, my website is powered by NextJS, and I secured my domain 
through [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/) for an incredibly affordable price, 
less than $10 for the first year. While I currently don't use a professional email, 
I'm actively considering acquiring one, especially for the AI Daya project.

## Color Scheme and Elegance
I'm eager to hear your thoughts on the color scheme of my website. My fondness for pink is evident, 
but I've tastefully added a touch of maroon to impart a more mature and sophisticated appearance. 
This color combination is reminiscent of natural lipstick shades, evoking a sense of elegance.
