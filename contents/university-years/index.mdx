I recently graduated from the university with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Reflecting on my university journey, I've discovered that my education encompassed much more than programming languages and algorithms. In this blog post, I'll share some of the invaluable lessons I've gleaned during my time as a university degree student.

## 1. Mastering Time Management: A Key to Success

Balancing full-time work with part-time university studies was a demanding feat. I had to skillfully juggle between my job and academics, highlighting the paramount importance of time management. This skill is indispensable in every field, especially in the realm of Computer Science. I also learned the significance of taking breaks and allowing myself moments of rest.

**My weekly schedule as a part-time student looked like this:**
- Monday: Work (9 am - 6 pm) and School (7 pm - 10 pm)
- Tuesday: Work (9 am - 6 pm) and Rest (Pursuing my hobbies)
- Wednesday: Work (9 am - 6 pm) and School (7 pm - 10 pm)
- Thursday: Work (9 am - 6 pm) and School assignments (7 pm - 10 pm)
- Friday: Work (9 am - 6 pm) and School Tests (7 pm - 10 pm)
- Saturday: School Projects (9 am - 6 pm) and Rest (Pursuing my hobbies)
- Sunday: School Assignments (9 am - 6 pm) and Rest (Pursuing my hobbies)

As you can see, I dedicated three days a week to rest and recharge, which helped me maintain a stress-free approach to my workload. Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and adopting a positive mindset were skills I cultivated over the years.

## 2. Harnessing the Power of Teamwork

I learned that collaboration can amplify productivity compared to solitary efforts. My classmates and I established communication channels through Discord and Telegram group chats, and we also utilized Google Drive for seamless file sharing and document collaboration. This collaborative approach streamlined our project work and assignments. We supported each other during challenging moments, sharing knowledge and lending a helping hand when needed. Teamwork proved to be a fundamental asset, particularly in the realm of Computer Science.

## 3. Effective Exam Preparation

During exam periods, the workload for school assignments and projects typically lightened, creating an opportunity for focused study. Again, effective time management was key. My secret weapon for maintaining concentration during study sessions was engaging in 'Study With Me' sessions. These sessions, as seen in popular YouTube videos, provided a sense of companionship and motivation while studying. These videos often include schedules and timed breaks, allowing me to structure my study time effectively. 

**Here are some 'Study With Me' videos I found helpful:**

- [Study with Me in Cafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulxkwpagNd8&list=PLrddbO2cJVRnwwIgqQTWJ8ZTMB1Z8fe7t&index=2)

Additionally, I incorporated regular exercise into my routine to maintain physical well-being alongside my academic pursuits.

By honing these skills and adopting effective strategies, I successfully navigated the challenges of my university years. These lessons extend beyond the classroom and are valuable assets as I embark on my journey beyond academia.
