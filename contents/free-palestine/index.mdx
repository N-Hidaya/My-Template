**The Manipulation of News**

*"The Scripted Narratives"*

In today's world, it's disheartening to discover that governments in some countries have resorted to nefarious acts, including the scripting of news to propagate their agendas.

**The Historical Context**

*"The Birth of Israel"*

So back to history, before the existence of Israel, there was a country called PALESTINE. During the NAZI occupation, Jews were hated among countries. So the Jews came to Palestine and begged for help. The warm welcome extended by Palestine led to a period of coexistence.

*"The Creation of Israel"*

Years have passed, until some Jews decided to overtake Palestine. So these Jews created a group called Israel. At first they wanted some part of the land, but they had planned to slowly increase the portion of the land to seize. So they asked for help in UK and US. Thinking that it will benefit them one day, US and UK agreed to help Israel take the land of PALESTINE. 

As tensions rose, Israel initiated actions against Palestine to expand its territory. 
Therefore, Israel started to strike some parts of Palestine in order to wipe out the land clean. Once Palestine felt triggered and in need of help, HAMAS sought to defend their country.

*"Media and Misrepresentation"*

The media played a significant role in shaping the narrative. Just after a little shots from HAMAS, the Israel cried to US and UK for help. Israel portrayed HAMAS as terrorists, even when the reality was far more complex. They created fake stories about HAMAS.

**The Human Cost**

*"The Suffering of the Palestinian People"*

The conflict took a heavy toll on the Palestinian population. Discover the heartbreaking stories of Palestinian civilians, including children, who faced violence, imprisonment, and unimaginable suffering.

Now, Israel managed to seize many parts of the land of Palestine and they are becoming more and more violent towards the civilians of Palestine. They have been torturing Palestinians in jail, killed many Palestinian civilians which are mostly children (population of children are higher than adults in Palestine), and they have injured many people. They don't just shoot bullets. They made the Palestinians suffer. I can't describe it here but I've seen too many videos of tortured Palestinians. You can find those videos in YouTube, Tik Tok and Instagram.
