> After a year of learning and working with the Flutter framework, 
I realized how simple and manageable it is compared to ReactJS/React Native. 
I code faster and complete my projects more efficiently using Flutter. 
Until now, I've only deployed Flutter applications to mobile platforms. 
This time, I will develop web applications using Flutter and deploy them for the world to see.

## Benefits of Flutter
- *Cross-Platform Development:* You can create applications for multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and Windows, using a single codebase.
- *Development Environment:* I use VSCode for Flutter development, but some developers prefer Android Studio.
- *Dart Programming Language:* Flutter uses Dart, a new and easy-to-understand programming language that handles null values effectively.
- *Straightforward Frontend Development:* Flutter uses simple English words for most of its keywords, making frontend development straightforward. There are numerous tutorials available for building stunning designs using Flutter. I recommend checking out MithKoko's tutorials on YouTube.
- *Faster Development:* It takes less time to develop apps with Flutter.
- *Easy Maintenance and Debugging:* Flutter applications are easy to maintain and debug.

## What About ReactJS?
- *Established Framework:* ReactJS has been around longer than Flutter, making it more familiar to most developers.
- *Job Market:* Many companies are seeking ReactJS developers, which can make it challenging for Flutter developers to find jobs. However, some startups see Flutter as having high potential for future impact.
- *Coding Complexity:* ReactJS can be trickier than Flutter when it comes to coding and is more sensitive and prone to errors.
- *Development Speed:* I often find that coding in ReactJS takes three times longer than developing an application with Flutter.
- *React Native:* For iOS development with React Native, a MacBook is required for smooth coding. Although Expo is an alternative, it may hinder progress.

## Conclusion
> Ultimately, the choice between Flutter and ReactJS depends on your time, energy, and career goals. 
If you aim to work in large companies and secure a stable programming job quickly, 
ReactJS might be the better option. Meanwhile, I highly recommend studying Flutter. 
Although there are currently fewer job opportunities for Flutter developers, 
this is likely to change in the future. Additionally, building your projects with Flutter can help create
your own business or serve as a portfolio for Flutter job interviews. Good luck!
