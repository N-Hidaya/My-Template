After 1 year of learning and working on the Flutter framework, 
I realized how simple and manageable it is as compared to ReactJS/React Native. 
I code faster, and complete my projects faster using Flutter. 
Until now, I've only deployed Flutter applications to mobile platforms. 
This time, I will try to develop web applications using Flutter and deploy it for the world to see.
